1. Remove Dupes:
unique_movie_genre = movie.genre.uniq
SELECT DISTINCT genre FROM movie;

2. filter records:
movies_with_rating_less_than_ten = Movie.where("rating <= ?", 10)
SELECT * FROM movie WHERE rating < 10;

reviewed_movies = Movie.where("reviewed == ?", true)
SELECT * FROM movie WHERE reviewed = true;

movies_with_name_marvel = Movie.name =~ /marvel/
SELECT * FROM movie WHERE name like 'marvel';

3. sort records:
post_descending = post.id.descending
SELECT * FROM post ORDER BY id DESC;

4. limit records returned:
ten_posts = post.limit(10)
SELECT * from post ORDER BY id ASC limit 10;

5. group records:
movies_genres = Movie.group_by(genre)
Select * from movie GROUP BY genre;

6. perform calculations:
number_of_users = User.count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user;

7. join tables:
cross_join_artist_album = Album.joins(:artist)
SELECT * FROM albums CROSS JOIN artists ON albums.artist_id = artists.id;

inner_join_artist_album = Album.join.where(artist_id: artists.id)
SELECT * From albums INNER JOIN artists ON albums.artist_id = artists.id;

outer_join_artist_album = Album.leftjoin.where(artists.id)
SELECT albums.name AS 'Album', albums.year, artists.name AS 'Artist' FROM albums OUTER JOIN artists ON albums.artist_id = artists.id WHERE albums.year > 1980;
